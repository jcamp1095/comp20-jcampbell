Joe Campbell 3/14/16 README.md

All elements of this program have been correctly implemented as verified by the sites given in the spec.

This project was made by me, Joe Campbell.

I aproximately spent 4 hours on this assignment.

Overview: This project contains a index.html, style.css, two image files, and 
a README.  The project creates a google map with the locations of everyone in the 
comp20 class and their locations (with a fake name).  It also contains the 
nearest landmarks (within a mile) mapped on the map.  The map displays 
a little person icon for each person, a tower for each landmark, and a smiley 
face for my location.  A line is also drawn between my marker and the nearest
locaton to me.
