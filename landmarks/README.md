Joe Campbell 3/14/16 README.md

All elements of this program have been correctly implemented as verified by the sites given in the spec.

This project was made by me, Joe Campbell.  The getDistance function was obtained from 
stackoverflow at this url: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.
Some of the structure relating to the google maps api was based on code written my Ming Chow.  

I aproximately spent 4 hours on this assignment.

Overview: This project contains a index.html, style.css, two image files, and 
a README.  The project creates a google map with the locations of everyone in the 
comp20 class and their locations (with a fake name).  It also contains the 
nearest landmarks (within a mile) mapped on the map.  The map displays 
a little person icon for each person, a tower for each landmark, and a smiley 
face for my location.  A line is also drawn between my marker and the nearest
locaton to me.
