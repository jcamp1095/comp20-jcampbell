1.  The purpose of this git repository is to contain a collection of all projects
    from comp20.  These projects are in a private collection (or repository) to maintain
    the academic integrity guidelines at Tufts Univeristy.  The repository allows one 
    to have a record of all iterations of a project as well through various commits.

2.  My favorite assignment/lab was assignment number 2 - Landmarks.  It was the first time
    that we really got to see a very interactive site using data from multiple sources.    It 
    was also at the time the most challenging assignment, but also the most satisfying when it 
    was completed.  

3.  From day 1 of this course, I have certainly grown as a programmer.  If nothing else, this course
    taught me how to use my resources around me such as documentation and stack overflow to work in 
    a professional environment.

4.  The most important thing that I learned from this course was how to interact with a server and
    get outside data into a program / post data using apis.    
        - Using the google maps api in conjunction with the class data for assignment two allowed
          me to comprehend the numerous things that can be accomplished using apis.  
        - In the group project now, getting data from other sites and companies allows an idea
          (like our project idea) to become a reality so much quicker.     

5.  I would like to go deeper into servers and databases to see how large amounts of data are
    stored and to see how it differs from what we've encountered.
