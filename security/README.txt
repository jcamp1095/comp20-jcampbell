Joe Campbell 4/26/16 README.txt

All elements of this program have been correctly implemented as verified by the sites given in the spec.

This project was made by me, Joe Campbell.  The source code was written by Michele Mei.  
The code for assignment 3 by Ming Chow was used as a reference to better security practices.  
Some ideas were discussed with Michael Morisi  

I aproximately spent 4 hours on this assignment.

Overview: This project contains an index.html page which provides
feedback on the security flaws on the assignment 2 and 3 code by Michele Mei
and offers suggestions on how to fix them.
